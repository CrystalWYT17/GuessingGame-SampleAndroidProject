**Sample Kotlin Project - Guessing Game**

This project is from [Udacity Kotlin Course](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud9012)

This app includes:
- show timer (currently 10sec)
- display score for each word
- can skip or got it
- words are randomly shown
- will appear final score after time's up
- can play again
- phone will vibrate when user click got it or timer is almost up or game is finished

In this app, you will learn about 
1. ViewModel
2. ViewModelFactory
3. Data Binding with ViewModel
4. LiveData and MutableData

In Udacity Course, most library are out-dated. I use latest library in my project. I fixed some of syntax which is different from video. 
You can search library [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle#kts).

 **I give credits to this course and instructors.**
